# NOAH Stock Bot — Project Notes for Claude

Operational rules for working in this repo. Apply to **every subproject** in
this repo (currently: `bot/` NOAH stock-bot, `trade/` Korea import/export bot).

## Default workflow — review first, commit only on request

For **any** request (analysis output, feature idea, bug report, refactor):

1. **Review and propose** — never edit/commit yet. Surface the diagnosis,
   the proposed change as a **generalized universal rule** (never a
   ticker-specific or one-off patch), and the trade-offs.
2. **Wait for explicit "커밋"** from the user before staging anything.
   Until then, the deliverable is the proposal itself, not committed code.
   The only exception is when the user opens with an explicit instruction
   to commit ("이대로 커밋", "스캐폴드 만들고 커밋해줘", etc.).
3. **After explicit commit**: stage, commit, and push to the current
   `claude/...` branch. Open / update the draft PR if one doesn't exist.

## Automation-first principle

**Every recurring operation MUST be automated** (cron / systemd timer /
asyncio task). The user runs operations alone and explicitly does not
want to ssh / paste shell commands when avoidable. Before proposing any
manual server step, ask: "can this be a cron job, systemd timer, asyncio
task, or in-process scheduler instead?" If a fix involves the operator
running a command more than once, the fix is wrong — re-design until the
runtime drives itself. Examples of what's already automated and the
pattern to follow:

- Bot lifecycle → systemd (`stock-bot.service`)
- Code updates → `stock-bot-update.service` polls git every 2 min and redeploys without manual intervention
- Stale process recovery → `stock-bot-watchdog.service` restarts if main loop hangs 12 min
- Memory pending-entry resolution → `_periodic_auto_resolve` asyncio task, 12 h cycle
- Daily dashboard regen → `_periodic_dashboard_refresh` asyncio task, 00:01 KST
- Journal log size → `SystemMaxUse=500M` in `journald.conf` (auto-trim)

**Acceptable manual steps** (rare, one-time):
- Initial systemd unit installation
- Secret rotation (API keys leaked, etc.)
- Investigating an unknown failure

**Unacceptable as a recurring ask**: "ssh in and run X every time Y happens." If it recurs, it must be automated. When proposing a fix, prefer (in order):
1. In-process scheduler (asyncio task / APScheduler)
2. systemd timer / oneshot service
3. Cron entry
4. Manual command (only if 1-3 are infeasible and impact is one-time)

## Help text maintenance (`_HELP_TEXT` in `bot/telegram_bot.py`)

The help text is **pinned as a channel announcement**. Treat it as a public-facing spec.

**Whenever a feature changes that affects user-visible behavior, update `_HELP_TEXT` in the same commit.** Specifically watch for changes in:

- New / removed commands → section 1 (명령어)
- Pipeline stage changes (analyst count, model tiers, retry logic) → section 2 (분석 흐름)
- New pre-fetched data signals → section 4 (자동 데이터 소스)
- New fundamentals RULEs → section 7 (안정성), update "RULE 1~N" count
- New stability / quality guards → section 7
- Dashboard changes → section 11

**Constraints when editing:**

- **Single Telegram message** — total ≤ 4096 UTF-16 units. Verify with:
  ```python
  import re
  text = re.search(r'_HELP_TEXT\s*=\s*"""(.*?)"""', open('bot/telegram_bot.py').read(), re.DOTALL).group(1)
  print(len(text.encode('utf-16-le')) // 2)  # must be < 4096
  ```
- Headroom target: keep ≥ 200 units of slack so future additions fit
- If a new feature pushes over the limit, **compress existing prose** rather than skip the new feature. Bullets → inline-separated phrases; explanatory commentary → terse phrasing
- **All slash commands MUST stay** (`/start`, `/help`, `/usage`, `/NVDA` etc., `/compare`)
- Content must reflect the CURRENT model state — no aspirational or deprecated features

**The help text doubles as a public spec AND a public roadmap.** Two surfaces to keep current:

1. **Current state description** — sections 2-11 describe what the model
   does TODAY. Every time a user-visible behavior changes (new analyst,
   new RULE, new pre-fetch source, new quality guard, new dashboard
   feature, dropped feature), update the relevant section in the same
   commit. Stale text is a bug.
2. **"현재 진행 중 / 예정" section** — a final section listing every
   open multi-step initiative (e.g. Korean market support Phase N,
   pending data-source integrations, planned model upgrades). Update
   this section in the same commit that creates / closes a TODO. The
   user pins the help as a channel announcement, so this section
   functions as a publicly-visible roadmap. Never let it drift.

Both surfaces must fit inside the 4096 UTF-16 cap — keep them concise.

## Stance / RULE counting

When user-facing prose mentions "분석가 4명" or "RULE 1~N", verify against code before editing:
- Analyst count: search `add_node` calls in `TradingAgents/tradingagents/graph/setup.py`
- RULE count: `grep "^.*RULE [0-9]" TradingAgents/tradingagents/agents/analysts/fundamentals_analyst.py`

## /start and /help

Already share a single function (`cmd_help`) and a single constant (`_HELP_TEXT`). Don't fork them — preserve the structural sync.

## Secrets

The user has accidentally pasted API keys in chat multiple times. When discussing `.env`, **always** suggest:
- `cat ~/stock/.env | sed 's/=.*$/=***REDACTED***/'` for sharing
- Never echo or quote the user's real key values back
- Recommend revocation if a real key was exposed

## Multi-market expansion (US → KR → JP → CN)

Phase tracking — what's done, what's blocking the next phase:

**Phase 0 — Infrastructure (done)**
- `bot/market.py` — `detect_market()` + `MARKET_CONFIG` (US/KR/JP/CN)
- `TICKER_RE` accepts numeric-start tickers (was the blocker for `005930.KS`)
- `_resolve_benchmark` picks KODEX sector ETFs for KR tickers
- `get_sector_relative_strength` uses KOSPI 200 as broad benchmark for KR

**Phase 1 — KR data sources (blocked on user)**
- DART API client (실적 일정 / 임원지분 / 공시) — needs user-supplied `DART_API_KEY`
- KR macro 9-series (USD/KRW, KOSPI VIX, KR10Y, etc.) — partly yfinance, partly 한은 API
- KR earnings calendar via DART (yfinance coverage too thin)
- KR insider holdings via DART (yfinance returns nothing useful)

**Phase 2 — KR validation + help text**
- Test `/005930.KS`, `/035720.KS`, `/000660.KS` end-to-end
- Re-add a KR usage note to `_HELP_TEXT` section 1 once Phase 1 ships
- Update CLAUDE.md analyst-count / RULE-count if any KR-specific rule lands

**Phase 3 — JP / CN expansion** (further out)
- Same shape: market-specific benchmark mapping + data source adapters
- TOPIX sector ETFs for JP, CSI 300 sectors for CN

## TODO

- **Korean sell-side consensus — free source research.** yfinance's
  `recommendationKey` / `targetMeanPrice` coverage on KRX-listed names
  is sparse. Investigate free sources before committing to a paid
  data feed: 네이버 금융 페이지 스크래핑 (ToS check), 한경 컨센서스
  스크래핑, KIS Developers API (한투 계좌 필요 여부 확인), 한국거래소
  KIND 시스템. The decision flow needs `targetMeanPrice` + `recommendationKey`
  + `numberOfAnalystOpinions` at minimum — anything that returns those
  three for arbitrary `.KS`/`.KQ` tickers is a candidate. Until this
  is resolved, Phase 1 ships KR analyses WITHOUT a consensus signal
  (the existing market-signals block will gracefully omit it).
